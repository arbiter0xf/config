# TODO finish ./configure help print

# TODO change include dir to $include_dir/bash

# TODO move non-path variables to another common sh from common_paths.sh

# TODO
# Special handling for help option. If -h or --help is found in the invoking
# command then do not handle any other arguments.
# Example error case: --nopath --help
# Solution: grep the invoking line for -h or --help

# TODO
# Add own common.sh for every script. The content will be shared with
# all other scripts by adding content of every owned common.sh to the
# main common.sh in common/ directory in build time.
# Only modify the main common.sh in out/ directory.
# Find all common.sh files under src/ and append them to one file:
# common.sh which is written to out/ dir.

# TODO remove leading dot from pulled files

# TODO add option for silencing hint messages

# TODO
# add --nopathcheck
# implement path asserting for all needed paths and
# switch option for disabling.

# TODO
# add include guards to all script files which might be sourced.
# Make include function which will keep track of already sourced
# script files. Previously unsourced files need to be sourced.

# TODO
# Add support for config files which are not dotfiles. Now only
# files beginning with "." are searched from config/

# TODO
# Add examples for use cases to README

# TODO
# when include guards have been implemented include file with __bold__
# variable to include/.../assert.sh in order to make ERROR in
print_error_line bold.

# TODO
# In Makefile the subprojects (listed in ALL_TARGETS) would not need to be
# added manually if a Makefile was to be added to each directory level and
# calling all makefiles of all subdirectories.
